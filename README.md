# BetterShift
Classic WOW addon for linking item in chat using different language with your client

BetterShift changes the behavior of your Shift-LeftClick combo when interacting with items in your inventory. The item linked in the chat window will be in English instead of the language of your wow client. You can still link the item in your client language using Alt-LeftClick. Can be extremely useful if you are playing on a server with a different language.
